# 💫 About Me:
I’m Deepak Gupta, a passionate Full Stack Developer currently working at LTIMindtree, where I build and maintain enterprise-grade web applications for global clients. My expertise lies in developing scalable, secure, and high-performing solutions using Java, Spring Boot, Angular, and Node.js. During my journey, I’ve led teams, collaborated across agile environments, and contributed to projects that blend functionality with great user experience.

I’m driven by continuous learning, teamwork, and the desire to solve real-world problems through technology.
